  - You....You took out those skeletons like it was nothing. You must be really powerful.
  - Oh, I'm A....Anjie, nice to meet you. I'm from the town up on the hill, Dunnmar.
  - It used to be a town bustling with life, now people are either fleeing or falling
    victim to the evil plaguing the town.
  - You see, many years ago, there was a man who lived where the town hall was. He
    used.......well, he used dark magic, and he kidnapped travellers on the roads
    and sacrified them for his rituals.
  - Eventually, the Army stepped in and destroy his manor. They dismembered him and
    sealed his remains deep beneath the earth, and his followers, were sealed under
    with him.....alive.
  - Some years later, after Dunnmar was founded, the dead began to rise and attack
    the town. A man from the town wielding a magical blade, delved into the crypts
    beneath the Graveyard to stop the evil.
  - He sealed the evil away, and peace was restored. But now the dead have begun to
    rise and evil seeps from the Undercrypt once more. We need a hero to put a stop
    to this once and for all.
