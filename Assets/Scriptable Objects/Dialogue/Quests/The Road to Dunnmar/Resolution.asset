  _dialogueSentences:
  - I'm the Lord of Dunnmar, welcome to the town.
  - What's this? A letter from Anjie....
  - '"My Lord, the man before you destroyed a group of skeletons on the road to Dunnmar.
    I know he can help us. I think you should give him the key to the Graveyard."'
  - So Anjie wants me to trust some passing stranger. What if you're secretly an enemy?
    Should I risk the town becoming more at risk by letting you anger whatever is
    lurking in the Undercrypt?
  - Then again.....I don't suppose I have a choice. We're already in grave danger,
    if you'll forgive the pun. We need someone to stop the evil.
  - If you think you're the man for the job, then come speak to me later when you're
    ready. Thanks for the information.
